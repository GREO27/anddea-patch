# anddea-patch
This repository contains YouTube and YouTube Music projects that I have built using Andea Patch. This project aims to provide modified versions of the YouTube and YouTube Music apps with additional features not available in the official versions.

 ## Notes
* Use [zygisk-detach](https://github.com/j-hc/zygisk-detach) to block Play Store from updating YouTube and YouTube-Music.
* Non-root versions of YouTube and YouTube-Music require [MicroG](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases) to work.
